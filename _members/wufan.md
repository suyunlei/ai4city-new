Dr. Wufan Zhao is currently an Assistant Professor at the Urban Governance and Design (UGOD) Thrust, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). He is the Principal Investigator (PI) of AI4DCity Lab. Before joining HKUST(GZ), he was a Research Fellow at Geomatics Group, KU Leuven. His research primarily focuses on AI-based remote sensing image understanding, 3D city modeling, multi-modal spatiotemporal data fusion, and their methodological and applied studies. His researches will specifically addresses challenges related to urban environments and socio-economic factors under various scales of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
